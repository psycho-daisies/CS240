1. Write a linear search algorithm both recursively and iteratively in pseudo code. Comment to explain.

2. Write the same linear search algorithms in the programming language of your choice. Comment to explain.

3. Rewrite the binary search algorithm from week 1 in a recursive form in pseudo code and in the programming language of your choice. Comment to explain.

4. Find a for loop you wrote in previous course work and rewrite it as a recursive function (it can not be a simple linear search problem). Please show the original code in your submission.

5. Use the following attached documents to test your search algorithms. numbers-3.txt
Download numbers-3.txt Use one of your sorting algorithms to sort the list first before implementing binary search. What position is 8128705 in?   What position is 5842193?
